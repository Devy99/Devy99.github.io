Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Informatics at Università della Svizzera italiana. Since October 2023, l am part of the [Software Institute](https://www.si.usi.ch/) and member of the [SEART group](https://seart.si.usi.ch/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gabriele Bavota](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/bavota/).

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Molise, where I successfully defended my thesis on `Automatic Refactoring of Dockerfiles` under the supervision of Prof. [Simone Scalabrino](https://dibt.unimol.it/staff/sscalabrino/) and [Giovanni Rosa](https://giovannirosa.com/).

I received my Master's degree in [Software System Security](https://www2.dipbioter.unimol.it/sicurezza-dei-sistemi-software/) and in [Software and Data Engineering](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/software-and-data-engineering) by participating in the double degree programme in Secure Software and Data Engineering and defending my thesis entitled `Investigating the Usage of Data Augmentation for Code Review Automation` under the supervision of Prof. Gabriele Bavota and the co-supervision of Prof. [Rocco Oliveto](http://docenti.unimol.it/index.php?u=rocco.oliveto) and [Rosalia Tufano](https://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/tufanr/).
