Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Informatics at Università della Svizzera italiana. Since October 2023, l am part of the [Software Institute](https://www.si.usi.ch/) and member of the [SEART group](https://seart.si.usi.ch/) under the supervision of Prof. [Gabriele Bavota](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/bavota/). 

My research focuses on `customizing` LLM-based code recommender systems to boost their usefulness and performance when exploited by specific `developers` (<i>e.g.,</i> a newcomer having little programming knowledge) and in specific `contexts` (<i>e.g.,</i> niche programming languages). You can find more information on [this poster](/assets/pdf/poster.pdf).

Previously, I received my Master's degree in [Software System Security](https://www2.dipbioter.unimol.it/sicurezza-dei-sistemi-software/) and in [Software and Data Engineering](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/software-and-data-engineering) defending my thesis entitled `Investigating the Usage of Data Augmentation for Code Review Automation`. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Molise, where I successfully defended my thesis on `Automatic Refactoring of Dockerfiles`.
